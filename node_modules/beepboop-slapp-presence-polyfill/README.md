Presence pollyfil for Beep Boop Slapp apps

[Slapp](https://github.com/BeepBoopHQ/slapp) Slack Apps favor the HTTP based integrations from the Slack API over the socket-based RTM, such as [Slack Events](https://api.slack.com/events-api), [Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) and [Interactive Messages](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button).  Currently (8/19/2016) there's no way to have your bot user show as online unless you're using an RTM connection.  Until Slack has a solution for this, this module allows your Slapp apps to have a bot user that shows as online when running on [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com).  We accomplish this by integrating our Multi-Team Socket Mode feature in Beep Boop, and creating an RTM connection for each team, which causes your bot to show as online ðŸ’š.

While this is definitely not optimal, as it creates an un-used RTM connection, it's meant as a temporary stop-gap until there is an official solution from Slack.

## Install

```
npm install --save beepboop-slapp-presence-polyfill
```

## Usage

Make sure you enable Multi-Team Socket Mode on your project, then plug this library into your Slapp app.
